A simple Javascript quiz I created. 

When a question is answered wrong, you lose 10 seconds. 

The user's answers are tallied and at the end the response that is given is based on the amount of questions the user answered correctly 

You can access the deployed version here: https://therealgeneparmesan.github.io/Javascript-Quiz/
